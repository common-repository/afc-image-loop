However, plugin does not require you to remember any format or syntax, as nothing needs to be entered manually - everything is done via quicktag menu. Open IMG_LOOP quicktag, then just select the XML file (might be blank), finally press configure button - from there everything is pretty straighforward - you simply use HTML form to populate your XML file. Once done, insert tag and publish post!
